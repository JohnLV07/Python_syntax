#Objective: The aim of this assignment is to get familiarized with basic arithmetic operations and understand how they can be applied in everyday situations.
#Task 1: Grocery Store Math Calculate the total cost of three items you'd commonly find in a grocery store, given their individual prices. For example, what would be the cost of bread, peanut butter, and jelly be? Prices don't need to be realistic!

peanut_butter = 5
bread = 8
jelly = 4

total_price = (peanut_butter + bread + jelly)
print(total_price)

 
#Task 2: Bank Interest If you have a savings account with a particular initial amount and a fixed yearly interest rate, calculate the total amount in your account after a year.
#So if you had $10,000 at a 7% interest write code that would tell us the amount at the end of the year. For the example the expected outcome would be $10,700.

savings = 10000
interest = .07
total_with_interest = (savings * interest)
total_amount = (total_with_interest + savings)
print(total_amount)
